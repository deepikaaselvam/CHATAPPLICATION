# 📡 Java Chat Application

A simple chat application built using Java AWT and Socket Programming. This project allows two users (Sender and Receiver) to communicate in real-time within a local network.

---

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A text editor or an IDE like Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or Visual Studio Code.

## 🚀Features

- Real-time message exchange between a Sender and a Receiver.
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Java AWT components.
- Efficient communication via socket programming.
- Easy-to-use interface with a Send Button and a Text Field for entering messages.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- The Receiver establishes a connection with the Sender on a specific port (e.g., 12000).
- Messages sent by the Sender are displayed in the Receiver's chat window and vice versa.
- The project uses `DataInputStream` and `DataOutputStream` for communication.

## 🌟 Project Structure
- **Sender.java**: Handles the sender's interface and message-sending functionality.
- **Receiver.java**: Handles the receiver's interface and message-receiving functionality.
- **Socket Communication**: Enables real-time data transfer between Sender and Receiver.

## 📜 Future Enhancements
- Add a feature for file sharing between users.
- Include an encryption mechanism for secure communication.
- Enhance the UI with modern design frameworks like JavaFX or Swing.
