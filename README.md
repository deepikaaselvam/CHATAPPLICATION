# Chat Application Project

## ⚙️ How It Works
- The Receiver establishes a connection with the Sender on a specific port (e.g., 12000).
- Messages sent by the Sender are displayed in the Receiver's chat window and vice versa.
- The project uses `DataInputStream` and `DataOutputStream` for communication.

## 🌟 Project Structure
- **Sender.java**: Handles the sender's interface and message-sending functionality.
- **Receiver.java**: Handles the receiver's interface and message-receiving functionality.
- **Socket Communication**: Enables real-time data transfer between Sender and Receiver.

## 📜 Future Enhancements
- Add a feature for file sharing between users.
- Include an encryption mechanism for secure communication.
- Enhance the UI with modern design frameworks like JavaFX or Swing.
